Project 1: Used Car Price Prediction -  https://github.com/Manjuhiten/Selling-Price-Prediction
 
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a used car price prediction website. First build a model using sklearn and random forest regressor using cars dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html that allows user to enter year, showroom price, kilometres Drived, number of owners previously had etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature engineering, , randomized search cv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools used for this  this project are
1.	Python
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization
4.	Sklearn for model building
5.	Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and Spyder as IDE
6.	Python flask for http server
7.	HTML for UI



Project 2 :Real-Estate-Price-Prediction - https://github.com/Manjuhiten/-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project-

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html  that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools used for this project covers,
1.	Python
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization
4.	Sklearn for model building
5.	Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and spyder IDE
6.	Python flask for http server

Project 3:Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection - https://github.com/Manjuhiten/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Objective

The objective in this project is to build machine learning models to classify or identify fraudulent card transactions from a given card transactions data.

Data Description

The dataset contains two-days credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced with a low percentage of fraudulent transactions within several records of normal transactions. The positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% (492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions) of all transactions. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. Feature 'Class' is the target variable with value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise

During model building I covered data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, feature scaling,modelling etc

Algorithm implemented :

ISOLATION FOREST :Isolation Forest is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that uses the two properties “Few” and “Different” of anomalies to detect their existence. Since anomalies are few and different, they are more susceptible to isolation Local Outlier Factor :The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is an unsupervised anomaly detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.

Naive Bayes::Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multi-class classification problems. The technique is easiest to understand when described using binary or categorical input values.

Technology and tools used for this project covers,

Python

Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

Matplotlib for data visualization

Sklearn for model building

Jupyter notebook, visual studio code
